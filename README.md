## Origin Story
When Among Us was at its peak popularity in late 2020, my friends and I would play it quite a bit. There was one map in particular, "Polus", that had these doors that killers were able to close to trap players in. You could open them if you solved a puzzle, but *if you were too slow you'd die*. I made this program to gain an advantage when playing with my friends, needless to say I was never door-trapped again :P
